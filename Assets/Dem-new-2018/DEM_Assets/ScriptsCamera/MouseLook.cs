// This is from the text book "Unity in Action: Multiplatform Game Development in C#" by Joseph Hocking.
// With some notes added by Cheryl Nielsen.
// MouseLook rotates the transform based on the mouse delta.
// To make an FPS style character:
// - Create a capsule.// Named the Player
// - Add the MouseLook script to the capsule. // On the Player
//   -> Set the mouse look to use MouseX. (You want to only turn character but not tilt it)
// - Add FPSInput script to the capsule  // On the Player
//   -> A CharacterController component will be automatically added.
//
// - Create a camera. Make the camera a child of the capsule (Player). 
//   Set location of the camera as the head of the player and set the rotation to match the player.
// - Add a MouseLook script to the camera.
//   -> Set the mouse look to use MouseY. (You want the camera to tilt up and down like a head. 
//      The character already turns.)
