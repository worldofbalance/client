The final branch that we worked on is named dev-dem-update2.
Both members worked on on the Unity game version: 
Unity 2017.3.1f1 Personal (64)bit with MonoDevelop 5.9.6
It works well on Windows 10, from inside the unity-game-client codebase, inside the Unity IDE.
Our game does not have a working Database or any Java code.

The game contains 3 scenes: MainMenu.unity, LeveSelect.unity, and Test_Box_AI.unity.
The starting scene of the game is MainMenu.unity.
